## Ball Mills vs Rod Mills
When the mill is rotated without feed or with very fine feed,the rods are in parallel alignment and in contact with one another for their full length.New feed entering at one end of the mill causes the rod charge to spread at that end.This produces a series of wedge shaped slots tapering toward the discharge end.The tumbling and rolling rods expend most of their crushing force on the.&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Different Types of Ball Mills 1.Different Types Of Ball Mil 2.Ball mills are commonly used for crushing and grinding the materials into an extremely fine form.These machines are widely used in mineral dressing processes,pyrotechnics,and selective laser sintering.3.Nano Ball Milling&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Nano Ball Milling 1.BALL MILLING METHOD By Aravind N.B 2.Nano materials can be defined as those materials which have structured components with size less than 100nm at least in one dimension.Nanotechnology is an advanced technology,which deals with the synthesis of nano particles,processing of the nano materials and their applications.Ball mills are the classic grinding plants: Around the world they are the most common installations.Ball mills convince thanks to their simple principle and low maintenance needs: They are robust,durable and extremely reliable in operation.By using ball mills in closed circuit with a separator,their efficiency can be increased even further.
